There is a lot of research effort devoted by researcher  into developing different techniques for neural networks compression, yet the community seems to lack standardised ways of evaluating and comparing between different compression techniques, which is key to identifying the most suitable compression technique for different applications.

% Methodology 
In this paper we contribute towards standardisation of neural network compression by providing a review of evaluation metrics. These metrics have been implemented into NetZIP, a standardised neural network compression bench.

% Results
We showcase some of the metrics reviewed
using three case studies focusing on object classification, object detection, and edge devices.
